Caching strategies


The cache sits on the side and the application directly talks to both the cache and the database.
Here’s what’s happening:
    1. The application first checks the cache.
    2.  If the data is found in cache, we’ve cache hit. The data is read and returned to the client.
    3.  If the data is not found in cache, we’ve cache miss. The application has to do some extra work. It queries the database to read the data, returns it to the client and stores the data in cache so the subsequent reads for the same data results in a cache hit.
Use Cases, Pros and Cons
Cache-aside caches are usually general purpose and work best for read-heavy workloads. Systems using cache-aside are resilient to cache failures. If the cache cluster goes down, the system can still operate by going directly to the database.
Another benefit is that the data model in cache can be different than the data model in database. E.g. the response generated as a result of multiple queries can be stored against some request id.
When cache-aside is used, the most common write strategy is to write data to the database directly. When this happens, cache may become inconsistent with the database. To deal with this, developers generally use time to live (TTL) and continue serving stale data until TTL expires. If data freshness must be guaranteed, developers either invalidate the cache entry or use an appropriate write strategy, as we’ll explore later.


Read-through cache sits in-line with the database. When there is a cache miss, it loads missing data from database, populates the cache and returns it to the application.
Use Cases, Pros and Cons
While read-through and cache-aside are very similar, there are at least two key differences:
    1. In cache-aside, the application is responsible for fetching data from the database and populating the cache. In read-through, this logic is usually supported by the library or stand-alone cache provider.
    2. Unlike cache-aside, the data model in read-through cache cannot be different than that of the database.

Read-through caches work best for read-heavy workloads when the same data is requested many times. For example, a news story. The disadvantage is that when the data is requested the first time, it always results in cache miss and incurs the extra penalty of loading data to the cache. Developers deal with this by ‘warming’ or ‘pre-heating’ the cache by issuing queries manually. Just like cache-aside, it is also possible for data to become inconsistent between cache and the database, and solution lies in the write strategy, as we’ll see next.


In this write strategy, data is first written to the cache and then to the database. The cache sits in-line with the database and writes always go through the cache to the main database.
Use Cases, Pros and Cons
On its own, write-through caches don’t seem to do much, in fact, they introduce extra write latency because data is written to the cache first and then to the main database. But when paired with read-through caches, we get all the benefits of read-through and we also get data consistency guarantee, freeing us from using cache invalidation techniques.

Write-Around
Here, data is written directly to the database and only the data that is read makes it way into the cache.
Use Cases, Pros and Cons
Write-around can be combine with read-through and provides good performance in situations where data is written once and read less frequently or never. For example, real-time logs or chatroom messages. Likewise, this pattern can be combined with cache-aside as well.



Here, the application writes data to the cache which acknowledges immediately and after some delay, it writes the data back to the database.
This is sometimes called write-behind as well.
Use Cases, Pros and Cons
Write back caches improve the write performance and are good for write-heavy workloads. When combined with read-through, it works good for mixed workloads, where the most recently updated and accessed data is always available in cache.
It’s resilient to database failures and can tolerate some database downtime. If batching or coalescing is supported, it can reduce overall writes to the database, which decreases the load and reduces costs, if the database provider charges by number of requests.


Most relational databases storage engines (i.e. InnoDB) have write-back cache enabled by default in their internals. Queries are first written to memory and eventually flushed to the disk.
